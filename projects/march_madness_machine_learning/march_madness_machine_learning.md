This project presents a custom-built predictive modeling pipeline designed specifically for Kaggle's March Machine Learning Mania 2025 competition, where you can submit up to 2 files to be scored for competition. Developing independently as a personal challenge during free time, the programs leverage advanced machine learning techniques to create two models, each used to generate a submission file for competition. The two models developed were a deep neural network architectures, to forecast outcomes of the NCAA men's basketball tournament games. The project incorporates detailed exploratory data analysis, feature engineering from historical game results, team statistics, coaching data, and tournament trends. The outcome is an insightful and robust predictive model capable of estimating game probabilities and enhancing strategic predictions in competitive data science contexts.
